! According to https://github.com/AdguardTeam/tsurlfilter/tree/epic/tswebextension/packages/tsurlfilter/src/rules/declarative-converter#badfilter
! $badfilter works only within the scope of one static filter or within the scope of all dynamic rules (custom filters with user rules).
! Problematic rules comes from Liste AR, and it looks like that $badfilter does not work in this case in MV3 extension when it's loaded from Base filter (works fine in user rules),
! so we need to use exception rules for MV3 extension.
