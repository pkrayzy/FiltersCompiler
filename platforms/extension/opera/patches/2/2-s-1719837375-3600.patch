! SSAP ads - fix for Firefox extension
! Firefox extension cannot download new JavaScript rules, so we need to use a workaround by using $replace rule
! Another problem is that commas must be escaped, but in Firefox extension escaped commas in "replacement" part are not converted to normal commas,
! so we need to use capturing group for the comma and use it in the script
! TODO: remmove it when new version of the extension will be released (current version is 4.3.53)
